# Data Storage Formats

This page collects resources that deal with storing complex, hierarchical/binary data to file.

Alternatively, taking an excerpt from [bsdf.io](http://bsdf.io/):
 > \[...\] data specification for serializing (scientific) data, for the purpose of storage and (inter process) communication.


## Issue
 - Many file formats are designed to store complex hierarchical data in a "human-readable" format.
 - The misnomer is that "human-readable" really means these files can be read/edited with simple text editors.
 - In reality, these formats are error-prone/difficult for humans to edit, and even understand.
 - As dataset complexity increases, simple text editors unavoidably assure the eventuality of errors.
 - What is really needed to ensure "human-readability" is a simple, flexible application to view/edit files.

## Goal
Thus, these data storage formats might as well provide the following components:
 1. A solid, flexible, hierarchical *binary* format.
 1. A simple-to-use editor/reader.

## Analogy: `LaTeX` vs .pdf
 - `TeX`/`LaTeX` documents can be generated using simple text editors.
 - Humans have difficulty reading `TeX`/`LaTeX` documents (not very "human-readable").
 - The Portable Document Format (.pdf files) generate documents that are very much "human-readable".
 - \.pdf documents are written to a binary file format that are not easily deciphered with simple text editors.
 - To enable "human-readability", .pdf viewers are provided.

 - CSV: (Not typically hierarchical)
 - JSON
 - YAML
 - XML
